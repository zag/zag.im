</VERSION><h1>Pod
</h1><p><dfn>Pod</dfn> is an easy-to-use markup language with a simple, consistent
underlying document object model. Pod can be used for writing language
documentation, for documenting programs and modules, as well as for
other types of document composition.
</p><p>Pod is an evolution of Perl 5's <em>Plain Ol' Documentation</em>
(POD) markup. Compared to POD, Perl 6's Pod is much more
uniform, somewhat more compact, and considerably more expressive. The
Pod dialect also differs in that it is a purely descriptive mark-up
notation, with no presentational components.
</p><h2>General syntactic structure
</h2><p>Pod documents are specified using <dfn>directives</dfn>, which are
used to declare configuration information and to delimit blocks of
textual content. All Pod directives are considered to be special types
of comments in Perl 6.
</p><p>Every directive starts either with an equals sign (<code>=</code>) followed
immediately by an identifier <sup><a href='#ftn.nid1' name='nid1'>[1]</a></sup>, or with
<code>#=</code> followed immediately by whitespace or an opening bracket.
</p><p>Directives that start with <code>=</code> can be indented like the code they
interleave, but their initial <code>=</code> must still be the first non-whitespace
character on their line. Directives that start with <code>#=</code> can be placed
anywhere that a Perl 6 comment can appear, though they are meaningful
only in a subset of those places; see <a href='#Declarator blocks'>#Declarator blocks</a>.
</p><p>An indented Pod block is considered to have a <em>virtual left margin</em>,
determined by the indentation of its opening delimiter.
</p><p>In other words, if a directive is indented from the left margin, the
column at which the first character of its opening delimiter appears is
thereafter considered the first column of the entire block's contents.
</p><p>As with Perl 6 heredocs, the virtual margin treats leading tabs as
aligning to tabstops spaced every <code>($?TABSTOP // 8)</code> characters.
</p><h2>Pod blocks
</h2><p>The content of a document is specified within one or more <dfn>blocks</dfn>.
Every Pod block may be declared in any of four forms:
</p><p><a href='#Delimited blocks'><em>delimited style</em></a>, <a href='#Paragraph'><em>paragraph style</em></a>, <a href='#Abbreviated blocks'><em>abbreviated style</em></a>, or <a href='#Declarator blocks'><em>declarator
style</em></a>. The first three forms are all equivalent; the
fourth is distinct.
</p><p>Anything in a document that is neither a Pod directive nor contained
within a Pod block is treated as "ambient" material. Typically this
would be the source code of the program that the Pod is documenting. Pod
parsers still parse this text into the internal representation of the
file, representing it as a <code>Pod6::Block::Ambient</code> block. Renderers
will <em>usually</em> ignore such blocks, but see <a href='#Aliases'>#Aliases</a>.
</p><p>In Perl 5's POD format, once a POD directive is encountered, the parser
considers everything that follows to be POD, until an explicit <code>=cut</code>
directive is encountered, at which point the parser flips back to
parsing ambient source code. The Perl 6 Pod format is different. All Pod
directives have a defined terminator and the Pod parser always reverts to
"ambient" at the end of each Pod directive or block. To cause the parser
to remain in Pod mode, you must enclose the desired Pod region in a
<code>pod</code> block:
</p><pre><code>    <strong>=begin pod</strong>

    =head1 A heading

    This is Pod too. Specifically, this is a simple C&lt;para&gt; block

        $this = pod('also');  # Specifically, a code block

    <strong>=end pod</strong>
</code></pre><h3>Delimited blocks
</h3><p>Delimited blocks are bounded by <code>=begin</code> and <code>=end</code> markers, both of
which are followed by a valid Perl 6 identifier, which is the
<dfn>typename</dfn> of the block. Typenames that are entirely lowercase (for
example: <code>=begin head1</code>) or entirely uppercase (for example: <code>=begin
SYNOPSIS</code>) are reserved.
</p><p>After the typename, the rest of the <code>=begin</code> marker line is treated as
configuration information for the block. This information is used in
different ways by different types of blocks, but is always specified using
Perl6-ish option pairs. That is, any of:
</p><blockquote><table><tr><th>Value is...</th><th>Specify with...</th><th>Or with...</th><th>Or with...</th></tr><tr><td>Boolean (true)</td><td>C«:key»</td><td>C«:key(1)»</td><td>C«key =&gt; 1»</td></tr><tr><td>Boolean (false)</td><td>C«:!key»</td><td>C«:key(0)»</td><td>C«key =&gt; 0»</td></tr><tr><td>String</td><td>C«:key&lt;str&gt;»</td><td>C«:key('str')»</td><td>C«key =&gt; 'str'»</td></tr><tr><td>List</td><td>C«:key&lt;1 2 3&gt;»</td><td>C«:key[1,2,3]»</td><td>C«key =&gt; [1,2,3]»</td></tr></table></blockquote><p>All option keys and values must, of course, be constants since Pod is a
specification language, not a programming language. Specifically, option
values cannot be closures. See Synopsis 2 for details of the various
Perl 6 pair notations.
</p><p>The configuration section may be extended over subsequent lines by
starting those lines with an <code>=</code> in the first (virtual) column followed
by a whitespace character.
</p><p>The lines following the opening delimiter and configuration are the
data or contents of the block, which continue until the block's matching
<code>=end</code> marker line. For most block types, these contents may be
indented if you wish, without them being treated as <a href='#Code'>code blocks</a>. Unlike Perl 5, indented text is only treated as code within
<code>=pod</code>, <a href='#Nesting blocks'><code>=nested</code></a>, <a href='#Lists'><code>=item</code></a>, <code>=code</code>,
and <a href='#Semantic blocks'>semantic</a> blocks.
</p><p>The general syntax is:
</p><pre><code>     =begin <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>OPTIONAL CONFIG INFO</var>
     =                  <var>OPTIONAL EXTRA CONFIG INFO</var>
     <var>BLOCK CONTENTS</var>
     =end <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>
</code></pre><p /><p>For example:
</p><pre><code>     =begin table  :caption&lt;Table of Contents&gt;
         Constants           1

         Variables           10

         Subroutines         33

         Everything else     57
     =end table

        =begin Name  :required
        =            :width(50)
        The applicant's full name
        =end Name

        =begin Contact  :optional
            The applicant's contact details
        =end Contact
</code></pre><p /><p>Note that no blank lines are required around the directives; blank
lines within the contents are always treated as part of the contents.
This is a universal feature of Pod.
</p><p>Note also that in the following specifications, a "blank line" is a line
that is either empty or that contains only whitespace characters. That
is, a blank line matches the Perl 6 pattern: <code>/^^ \h* $$/</code>. Pod uses
blank lines as delimiters, rather than empty lines, to minimize unpleasant
surprises when stray spaces or tabs mysteriously turn up in hitherto
empty lines.
</p><h3>Paragraph blocks
</h3><p>Paragraph blocks are introduced by a <code>=for</code> marker and terminated by
the next Pod directive or the first blank line (which is <em>not</em>
considered to be part of the block's contents). The <code>=for</code> marker is
followed by the name of the block and optional configuration
information. The general syntax is:
</p><pre><code>     =for <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>OPTIONAL CONFIG INFO</var>
     =                <var>OPTIONAL EXTRA CONFIG INFO</var>
     <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
</code></pre><p /><p>For example:
</p><pre><code>     =for table  :caption&lt;Table of Contents&gt;
         Constants           1
         Variables           10
         Subroutines         33
         Everything else     57

        =for Name  :required
        =          :width(50)
        The applicant's full name

     =for Contact  :optional
        The applicant's contact details

</code></pre><h3>Abbreviated blocks
</h3><p>Abbreviated blocks are introduced by an <code>'='</code> sign in the
first column, which is followed immediately by the typename of the
block. The rest of the line is treated as block data, rather than as
configuration. The content terminates at the next Pod directive or the
first blank line (which is not part of the block data). The general
syntax is:
</p><pre><code>     =<var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
     <var>MORE BLOCK DATA</var>

</code></pre><p /><p>For example:
</p><pre><code>     =table
         Constants           1
         Variables           10
         Subroutines         33
         Everything else     57

        =Name  The applicant's full name
     =Contact  The applicant's contact details

</code></pre><p /><p>Note that abbreviated blocks cannot specify configuration information. If
configuration is required, use a <code>=for</code> or <code>=begin</code>/<code>=end</code> instead.
</p><h3>Declarator blocks
</h3><p>The fourth form of Pod block differs from the first three in that it
does not specify an explicit typename. Instead, it obtains its identity
and purpose from the Perl 6 source code to which it is attached;
specifically, from some nearby declarator.
</p><p>Declarator blocks are introduced by a special Perl comment: <code>#=</code>, which
must be immediately followed by either by a space or an opening bracket.
If followed by a space, the block is terminated by the end of line; if
followed by one or more opening brackets, the block is terminated by
the matching sequence of closing brackets.
</p><p>That is, declarator Pod blocks are syntactically like ordinary Perl 6
single-line comments and embedded comments. The general syntax is:
</p><pre><code>     #= <var>BLOCK DATA TO END OF LINE</var>

     #={ <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
         <var>MORE BLOCK DATA</var>
       }

</code></pre><p /><p>except that the second form may use <em>any</em> valid Perl 6 bracket delimiter
(including repeated opening brackets), as described in Synopsis 2.
</p><p>Declarator Pod blocks must either precede or immediately follow a valid
Perl 6 declarator, and are then said to be "attached" to it. They are
primarily intended to simplify the documentation of code interfaces.
For example:
</p><pre><code>
    #= Base class for comms necromancy hierarchy
    class Magic::Necrotelecomnicon {
        has $.elemental;  #= Source of all power
        has $!true_name;  #  Source of all self-protection (not documented)

        method cast(Spell $s)
        #= Initiate a specified spell normally
        {
            do_raw_magic($s);
        }


        method kast(  #= Initiate a specified spell abnormally
            Spell $s     #= The spell to be abnormally initiated
        ) {
            do_raw_magic($s, :alternative);
        }

        #= This subroutine does the real work
        sub do_raw_magic (
            Spell $s,         #= Which spell to invoke
            *%options         #= How to invoke it
        ) {...}
    }
</code></pre><p /><p>Each declarator block is appended to the <code>.WHY</code> attribute of the
declared entity (object or type) whose declarator appeared at the
<em>start</em> of the nearest preceding line, provided that declarator is
"attached" to the Pod comment (i.e. it must not be separated from it
by an entirely blank line). That is:
</p><pre><code>    my $chainsaw;        #= This text stored in C&lt;$chainsaw.WHY&gt;

    sub fu (             #= This text stored in C&lt;&amp;fu.WHY&gt;
        Any     $bar,    #= This text stored in C&lt;$bar.WHY&gt;
        Mode    :$baz,   #= This text stored in C&lt;$baz.WHY&gt;
        Context :$the_context_in_which_we_fu?
                         #= This stored in C&lt;$the_context_in_which_we_fu.WHY&gt;
    ) { ... }

    sub fu2 (Any $bar)
    #=[ This text stored in C&lt;&amp;fu2.WHY&gt;, not in C&lt;$bar.WHY&gt;,
        (because C&lt;sub fu2&gt; is the declarator
         at the I&lt;start&gt; of the preceding line)
      ]

    multi sub baz(Int $count, Str $name)
        #=[ This text stored in C&lt;&amp;baz:(Int,Str).WHY&gt;
            (i.e. the C&lt;.WHY&gt; of the variant, not of the entire multisub)
          ]
</code></pre><p /><p>If a declarator block is <em>not</em> immediately preceded by an attached line
that begins with a declarator, then the declarator block is instead
appended to the <code>.WHY</code> attribute of the <em>next</em> declarator encountered,
which must also begin at the next non-whitespace token. For example:
</p><pre><code>    #= This text stored in C&lt;$chainsaw.WHY&gt;
    my $chainsaw;

    #=[ This text stored in C&lt;&amp;fu.WHY&gt;
        (because its delarator is the next non-ws token)
      ]

    sub fu (Any $bar) {...}
</code></pre><p /><p>Note that the second Pod comment in this example documents the <code>&amp;fu</code>
that comes after it, not the <code>$chainsaw</code> preceding it, because it is
not "attached" to <code>$chainsaw</code>, being separated from it by a blank line.
</p><p>In other words, Declarator blocks are assumed to document the
declarator they immediately follow (i.e. without intervening blank
lines), or if they don't immediately follow a declarator, to
document the declarator they precede (regardless of intervening
whitespace). This is intended to support and DWIM with most
standard layout approaches for commenting and inline documention.
</p><p>A declarator can have both a leading and a trailing Pod comment, in
which case they are concatenated with an intermediate newline:
</p><pre><code>   #= This is a special chainsaw
   my SwissArmy $chainsaw    #= (It has a rocket launcher)

   say $chainsaw.WHY;    # prints: This is a special chainsaw
                         #         (It has a rocket launcher)

</code></pre><p /><p>The Pod object representing each Declarator block is still appended to
the current surrounding Pod object (e.g. to <code>$=POD</code> at the top level).
Each such block representation is an object of class
<code>Pod6::Block::Declarator</code>, and has a <code>.WHEREFORE</code> method that returns
the code object or metaobject created by the declarator to which the
documentation is attached.
</p><p>When the <a href='#How Pod is parsed and processed'>default <code>DOC INIT</code> block</a>
renders these Pod objects, it automatically includes information about
the declarator as well. For instance, the earlier Necrotelecomnicon
example might produce something like:
</p><pre><samp>      Name:  Magic::Necrotelecomnicon:
      Desc:  Base class for comms necromancy hierarchy

      Attrs:
           .elemental       : Source of all power

      Methods:
           .cast(Spell $s)  : Initiate a specified spell normally
           .kast(Spell $s)  : Initiate a specified spell abnormally

      Subroutines:
        do_raw_magic(       : This subroutine does the real work
            Spell $s,         : Which spell to invoke
            *%options         : How to invoke it
        )

</samp></pre><p /><p>Note, however, that the exact rendering used for declarator blocks is
implementation dependent, and may also be pre-empted explicitly by some
<a href='#How Pod is parsed and processed'><code>DOC</code> configuration statement</a>
within the document, such as:
</p><pre><code>    DOC use Pod6::Markovian;
</code></pre><p>or:
</p><pre><code>    DOC INIT {
        use Pod6::Eiffelish::Long;
</code></pre><pre><code>        say eiffelish_long($=POD);
</code></pre><pre><code>        exit;
    }
</code></pre><h3>Block equivalence
</h3><p>The first three block specifications (delimited, paragraph, and
abbreviated) are treated identically by the underlying documentation
model, so you can use whichever form is most convenient for a particular
documentation task. In the descriptions that follow, the abbreviated
form will generally be used, but should be read as standing for all
three forms equally.
</p><p>For example, although <a href='#Headings'>#Headings</a> shows only:
</p><pre><code>     =head1 Top Level Heading
</code></pre><p /><p>this automatically implies that you could also write that block as:
</p><pre><code>     =for head1
     Top Level Heading
</code></pre><p /><p>or:
</p><pre><code>     =begin head1
     Top Level Heading
     =end head1
</code></pre><p /><p>Declarator blocks are distinct from these three forms. They do not have
typenames of their own, but rather take their meaning and identity from
the declared object or type to which they are attached. In general, they
are used specifically to describe that declarand.
</p><h3>Standard configuration options
</h3><p>Pod predefines a small number of standard configuration options that can be
applied uniformly to any built-in block type. These include:
</p><dl><dt><strong><code>:nested</code></strong></dt><dd><p>
This option specifies that the block is to be nested within its current
context. For example, nesting might be applied to block quotes, to textual
examples, or to commentaries. In addition the <a href='#Code blocks'><code>=code</code></a>,
<a href='#Lists'><code>=item</code></a>, <a href='#I/O blocks'><code>=input</code></a>, and <a href='#I/O blocks'><code>=output</code></a>
blocks all have implicit nesting.</p><p>Nesting of blocks is usually rendered by adding extra indentation to the
block contents, but may also be indicated in other ways:
by boxing the contents, by changing the font or size of the nested text,
or even by folding the text (so long as a visible placeholder is provided).</p><p>Occasionally it is desirable to nest content by more than one level:</p></dd><pre><code>    =begin para :nested
    =begin para :nested
    =begin para :nested
    "We're going deep, deep, I&lt;deep&gt; undercover!"
    =end para
    =end para
    =end para
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>This can be simplified by giving the <code>:nested</code> option a positive integer
value:

</dd><pre><code>    =begin para <strong>:nested(3)</strong>
    "We're going deep, deep, I&lt;deep&gt; undercover!"
    =end para
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>You can also give the option a value of zero, to defeat any implicit
nesting that might normally be applied to a paragraph. For example, to
specify a block of code that should appear <em>without</em> its usual
nesting:

</dd><pre><code>    =comment Don't nest this code block in the usual way...
    <strong>=begin code :nested(0)</strong>

                 1         2         3         4         5         6
        123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
        |------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
          line        instruction                comments
         number           code

    <code>=end code</code>
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>Note that <code>:!nested</code> could also be used for this purpose:

</dd><pre><code>    =Z&lt;&gt;begin code :!nested
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>:numbered</code></strong></dt><dd><p>
This option specifies that the block is to be numbered. The most common
use of this option is to create <a href='#Numbered headings'>numbered headings</a> and
<a href='#Ordered lists'>ordered lists</a>, but it can be applied to any block.</p><p>The numbering conventions for headings and lists are specified in those
sections, but it is up to individual renderers to decide how to display
any numbering associated with other types of blocks.</p><p>Note that numbering is never explicit; it is always implied by context.</p></dd><dt><strong><code>:formatted</code></strong></dt><dd><p>
This option specifies that the contents of the block should be treated as if
they had one or more <a href='#Formatting codes'>formatting codes</a> placed around them.</p><p>For example, instead of:</p></dd><pre><code>    =for comment
        The next para is both important and fundamental,
        so doubly emphasize it...

    =begin para
    B&lt;I&lt;
    Warning: Do not immerse in water. Do not expose to bright light.
    Do not feed after midnight.
    &gt;&gt;
    =end para
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>you can just write:

</dd><pre><code>    =begin para <strong>:formatted&lt;B I</strong>&gt;
    Warning: Do not immerse in water. Do not expose to bright light.
    Do not feed after midnight.
    =end para
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd><p>The internal representations of these two versions are exactly the same,
except that the second one retains the <code>:formatted</code> option information
as part of the resulting block object.</p><p>Like all formatting codes, codes applied via a <code>:formatted</code> are
inherently cumulative. For example, if the block itself is already
inside a formatting code, that formatting code will still apply, in
addition to the extra "basis" and "important" formatting specified by
<code>:formatted&lt;B I</code>&gt;.
</p></dd><dt><strong><code>:like</code></strong></dt><dd>
This option specifies that a block or config has the same formatting
properties as the type named by its value. This is useful for creating
related <a href='#Block pre-configuration'>configurations</a> or for making
user-defined synonyms for existing types. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    =config head2  :like&lt;head1&gt; :formatted&lt;I&gt;

    =config Subhead :like&lt;head2&gt;
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>:allow</code></strong></dt><dd>This option expects a list of formatting codes that are to be recognized
within any <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> codes that appear in (or are implicitly applied to)
the current block. The option is most often used on <code>=code</code> blocks to
allow mark-up within those otherwise verbatim blocks, though it can be
used in <em>any</em> block that contains verbatim text. See <a href='#Formatting'>#Formatting</a>.
</dd><dt><strong><code>:margin</code></strong></dt><dd>
This option specifies a character that indicates the left margin of the
contents of the block. Normally this left margin is determined by the column
at which the <code>=</code> of the opening block-delimiter occurs. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    =head1 Indenting Pod blocks

        =begin para
        This text is flush with the (virtual) left margin of
        the Pod block because that margin is implicitly specified
        by the C&lt;=&gt; of the C&lt;=begin&gt;
        =end para
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>However, by using the <code>:margin</code> option it is possible to specify a
character that acts like an explicit margin when it occurs as the first
non-whitespace character on any line within the block. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    =head1 Indenting Pod blocks

        =begin para :margin&lt;|&gt;
            |This text is flush with the (virtual) left margin of
            |the Pod block because that margin is explicitly marked
            |by the C&lt;|&gt;, as specified by the block's C&lt;:margin&lt;|&gt;&gt; option.
        =end para
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>The virtual margin can even be to the left of the opening delimiter, which can
be convenient to guide subsequent indentations. For example:

</dd><pre><code>       sub foo {

           V&lt;=begin&gt; pod :margin&lt;|&gt;
           |=head1 Hey Look: Indented Pod!
           |
           |You can indent Pod in Perl 6
           |which makes code look cleaner
           |when documentation is interspersed
           |
           |     my $this is Code;
           |
           |=end pod

           ...
       }
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd><p>When a <code>:margin</code> option is used, each subsequent line (until the
corresponding closing delimiter is encountered) simply has any text matching
<code>/^^ \s* $margin_char/</code> automatically removed. This may include a line that
then becomes the closing delimiter, as in the above example.</p><p>Any line from which such a margin marker is removed automatically resets
the implicit margin for subsequent lines of the block, setting it to the
length of the "marginalized" indent that was just removed. This implicit
margin is then used until the next line with an explicit margin marker
is encountered, or the block terminates.</p></dd></dl><h2>Block types
</h2><p>Pod offers notations for specifying a wide range of standard block types...
</p><h3>Headings
</h3><p>Pod provides an unlimited number of levels of heading, specified by the
<code>=head</code><var>N</var> block marker. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =head1 A Top Level Heading

      =head2 A Second Level Heading

        =head3 A third level heading

                        =head86 A "Missed it by I&lt;that&gt; much!" heading
</code></pre><p /><p>While Pod parsers are required to recognize and distinguish all levels
of heading, Pod renderers are only required to provide distinct
<em>renderings</em> of the first four levels of heading (though they may, of
course, provide more than that). Headings at levels without distinct
renderings would typically be rendered like the lowest distinctly
rendered level.
</p><h4>Numbered headings
</h4><p>You can specify that a heading is numbered using the <code>:numbered</code> option. For
example:
</p><pre><code>    =for head1 :numbered
    The Problem

    =for head1 :numbered
    The Solution

        =for head2 :numbered
        Analysis

            =for head3
            Overview

            =for head3
            Details

        =for head2 :numbered
        Design

    =for head1 :numbered
    The Implementation
</code></pre><p /><p>which would produce:
</p><blockquote><strong><p>1. The Problem</p><p>2. The Solution</p><blockquote><p>2.1. Analysis</p><blockquote><p>Overview</p><p>Details
</p></blockquote><p>
2.2: Design
</p></blockquote><p>
3. The Implementation
</p></strong></blockquote><p /><p>It is usually better to preset a numbering scheme for each heading
level, in a series of <a href='#Block pre-configuration'>configuration blocks</a>:
</p><pre><code>    <strong>=config head1 :numbered
    =config head2 :numbered
    =config head3 :!numbered</strong>

    =head1 The Problem
    =head1 The Solution
    =head2   Analysis
    =head3     Overview
    =head3     Details
    =head2   Design
    =head1 The Implementation
</code></pre><p /><p>Alternatively, as a short-hand, if the first whitespace-delimited word
in a heading consists of a single literal <code>#</code> character, the <code>#</code> is
removed and the heading is treated as if it had a <code>:numbered</code> option:
</p><pre><code>    =head1 # The Problem
    =head1 # The Solution
    =head2   # Analysis
    =head3       Overview
    =head3       Details
    =head2   # Design
    =head1 # The Implementation
</code></pre><p /><p>Note that, even though renderers are not required to distinctly render
more than the first four levels of heading, they <em>are</em> required to
correctly honour arbitrarily nested numberings. That is:
</p><pre><code>    =head6 # The Rescue of the Kobayashi Maru
</code></pre><p /><p>should produce something like:
</p><blockquote><p><strong>2.3.8.6.1.9. The Rescue of the Kobayashi Maru</strong>
</p></blockquote><h3>Ordinary paragraph blocks
</h3><p>Ordinary paragraph blocks consist of text that is to be formatted into
a document at the current level of nesting, with whitespace
squeezed, lines filled, and any special <a href='#Formatting codes'>inline mark-up</a>
applied.
</p><p>Ordinary paragraphs consist of one or more consecutive lines of text,
each of which starts with a non-whitespace character at (virtual) column
1. The paragraph is terminated by the first blank line or block
directive. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =head1 This is a heading block

    This is an ordinary paragraph.
    Its text  will   be     squeezed     and
    short lines filled. It is terminated by
    the first blank line.

    This is another ordinary paragraph.
    Its     text    will  also be squeezed and
    short lines filled. It is terminated by
    the trailing directive on the next line.
        =head2 This is another heading block

        This is yet another ordinary paragraph,
        at the first virtual column set by the
        previous directive
</code></pre><p /><p>Within a <code>=pod</code>, <code>=item</code>, <code>=defn</code>, <code>=nested</code>, <code>=END</code>, or
<a href='#Semantic blocks'>semantic</a> block, ordinary paragraphs do not require
an explicit marker or delimiters, but there is also an explicit <code>para</code>
marker (which may be used anywhere):
</p><pre><code>     <strong>=para</strong>
     This is an ordinary paragraph.
     Its text  will   be     squeezed     and
     short lines filled.
</code></pre><p /><p>and likewise the longer <code>=for</code> and <code>=begin</code>/<code>=end</code> forms. For example:
</p><pre><code>     <strong>=begin para</strong>
         This is an ordinary paragraph.
         Its text  will   be     squeezed     and
         short lines filled.

         This is I&lt;still&gt; part of the same paragraph,
         which continues until an...
     <strong>=end para</strong>
</code></pre><p /><p>As the previous example implies, when any form of explicit <code>para</code> block
is used, any whitespace at the start of each line is removed during rendering.
In addition, within a delimited <code>=begin para</code>/<code>=end para</code> block, any
blank lines are preserved.
</p><h3>Code blocks
</h3><p>Code blocks are used to specify pre-formatted text (typically source
code), which should be rendered without rejustification, without
whitespace-squeezing, and without recognizing any inline formatting
codes. Code blocks also have an implicit <a href='#Nesting blocks'>nesting</a>
associated with them. Typically these blocks are used to show examples
of code, mark-up, or other textual specifications, and are rendered
using a fixed-width font.
</p><p>A code block may be implicitly specified as one or more lines of text,
each of which starts with a whitespace character at the block's virtual
left margin. The implicit code block is then terminated by a blank line.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    This ordinary paragraph introduces a code block:

        $this = 1 * code('block');
        $which.is_specified(:by&lt;indenting&gt;);
</code></pre><p /><p>Implicit code blocks may only be used within <code>=pod</code>, <code>=item</code>, <code>=defn</code>,
<code>=nested</code>, <code>=END</code>, or <a href='#Semantic blocks'>semantic</a> blocks.
</p><p>There is also an explicit <code>=code</code> block (which can be specified within
<em>any</em> other block type, not just <code>=pod</code>, <code>=item</code>, etc.):
</p><pre><code>     The C&lt;loud_update()&gt; subroutine adds feedback:

        <strong>=begin code</strong>

        sub loud_update ($who, $status) {
            say "$who -&gt; $status";

            silent_update($who, $status);
        }

        <strong>=end code</strong>
</code></pre><p /><p>As the previous example demonstrates, within an explicit <code>=code</code> block
the code can start at the (virtual) left margin. Furthermore, lines that
start with whitespace characters after that margin have subsequent
whitespace preserved exactly (in addition to the implicit nesting of the
code). Explicit <code>=code</code> blocks may also contain empty lines.
</p><h4>Formatting within code blocks
</h4><p>Although <code>=code</code> blocks automatically disregard all <a href='#Formatting codes'>formatting
codes</a>, occasionally you may still need to specify
some formatting within a code block. For example, you may wish
to emphasize a particular keyword in an example (using a <code>B&lt;&gt;</code> code). Or
you may want to indicate that part of the example is metasyntactic
(using the <code>R&lt;&gt;</code> code). Or you might need to insert a non-ASCII
character (using the <code>E&lt;&gt;</code> code).
</p><p>You can specify a list of formatting codes that should still be
recognized within a code block using the <code>:allow</code> option. The value of
the <code>:allow</code> option must be a list of the (single-letter) names of one
or more formatting codes. Those codes will then remain active inside the
code block. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =begin code :allow&lt; B R &gt;
    sub demo {
        B&lt;say&gt; 'Hello R&lt;name&gt;';
    }
    =end code
</code></pre><p /><p>would be rendered:
</p><pre><code>sub demo {
    <strong>say</strong> 'Hello <var>name</var>';
}
</code></pre><p /><p>Note that the use of the <code>:allow</code> option also makes it possible
for verbatim <a href='#Formatting codes'>formatting codes</a> (such as <code>C&lt;&gt;</code>
and <code>V&lt;&gt;</code>) to <a href='#Pre-configuring formatting codes'>contain other codes as well</a>.
</p><h3>I/O blocks
</h3><p>Pod also provides blocks for specifying the input and output of programs.
</p><p>The <code>=input</code> block is used to specify pre-formatted keyboard input,
which should be rendered without rejustification or squeezing of whitespace.
</p><p>The <code>=output</code> block is used to specify pre-formatted terminal or file
output which should also be rendered without rejustification or
whitespace-squeezing.
</p><p>Note that, like <code>=code</code> blocks, both <code>=input</code> and <code>=output</code> blocks have an
implicit level of nesting. They are also like <code>=code</code> blocks in that they
are typically rendered in a fixed-width font, though ideally all three blocks
would be rendered in distinct font/weight combinations (for example: regular
serifed for code, bold sans-serif for input, and regular sans-serif for
output).
</p><p>Unlike <code>=code</code> blocks, both <code>=input</code> and <code>=output</code> blocks honour any
nested formatting codes. This is particularly useful since a sample of
input will often include prompts (which are, of course, output).
Likewise a sample of output may contain the occasional interactive
component. Pod provides <a href='#Example specifiers'>special formatting codes</a>
(<code>K&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>T&lt;&gt;</code>) to indicate embedded input or output, so you can use
the block type that indicates the overall purpose of the sample (i.e. is
it demonstrating an input operation or an output sequence?) and then use
the "contrasting" formatting code within the block.
</p><p>For example, to include a small amount of input in a sample of output
you could use the <code>K&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code:
</p><pre><code>    =begin output
        Name:    Baracus, B.A.
        Rank:    Sgt
        Serial:  1PTDF007

        Do you want additional personnel details? <strong>K&lt;y&gt;</strong>

        Height:  180cm/5'11"
        Weight:  104kg/230lb
        Age:     49

        Print? <strong>K&lt;n&gt;</strong>
    =end output
</code></pre><h3>Lists
</h3><p>Lists in Pod are specified as a series of contiguous <code>=item</code> blocks. No
special "container" directives or other delimiters are required to
enclose the entire list. For example:
</p><pre><code>     The seven suspects are:

     =item  Happy
     =item  Dopey
     =item  Sleepy
     =item  Bashful
     =item  Sneezy
     =item  Grumpy
     =item  Keyser Soze
</code></pre><p /><p>List items have one implicit level of nesting:
</p><blockquote><p>The seven suspects are:</p><ul><li>Happy
</li><li>Dopey
</li><li>Sleepy
</li><li>Bashful
</li><li>Sneezy
</li><li>Grumpy
</li><li>Keyser Soze
</li></ul></blockquote><p /><p>Lists may be multi-level, with items at each level specified using the
<code>=item1</code>, <code>=item2</code>, <code>=item3</code>, etc. blocks. Note that <code>=item</code> is just
an abbreviation for <code>=item1</code>. For example:
</p><pre><code>     =item1  Animal
     =item2     Vertebrate
     =item2     Invertebrate

     =item1  Phase
     =item2     Solid
     =item2     Liquid
     =item2     Gas
     =item2     Chocolate
</code></pre><p /><p>which would be rendered something like:
</p><blockquote><p>&bull; Animal
</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ndash; Vertebrate
</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ndash; Invertebrate
</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>&bull; Phase
</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ndash; Solid
</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ndash; Liquid
</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ndash; Gas
</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&ndash; Chocolate
</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Pod parsers must issue a warning if a "level-<var>N+1</var>" <code>=item</code> block
(e.g. an <code>=item2</code>, <code>=item3</code>, etc.) appears anywhere except where there
is a preceding "level-<var>N</var>" <code>=item</code> in the same surrounding block. That
is, an <code>=item3</code> should only be specified if an <code>=item2</code> appears
somewhere before it, and that <code>=item2</code> should itself only appear if
there is a preceding <code>=item1</code>.
</p><p>Note that item blocks within the same list are not physically nested.
That is, lower-level items should <em>not</em> be specified inside
higher-level items:
</p><pre><code>    =comment WRONG...
    =begin item1          --------------
    The choices are:                    |
    =item2 Liberty        ==&lt; Level 2   |==&lt;  Level 1
    =item2 Death          ==&lt; Level 2   |
    =item2 Beer           ==&lt; Level 2   |
    =end item1            --------------
</code></pre><pre><code>    =comment CORRECT...
    =begin item1          ---------------
    The choices are:                     |==&lt; Level 1
    =end item1            ---------------
    =item2 Liberty        ==================&lt; Level 2
    =item2 Death          ==================&lt; Level 2
    =item2 Beer           ==================&lt; Level 2
</code></pre><h4>Ordered lists
</h4><p>An item is part of an ordered list if the item has a <code>:numbered</code>
configuration option:
</p><pre><code>     =for item1 :numbered
     Visito

     =for item2 :numbered
     Veni

     =for item2 :numbered
     Vidi

     =for item2 :numbered
     Vici
</code></pre><p /><p>This would produce something like:
</p><blockquote><p>1. Visito</p><blockquote><p>1.1. Veni</p><p>1.2. Vidi</p><p>1.3. Vici
</p></blockquote></blockquote><p /><p>although the numbering scheme is entirely at the discretion of the
renderer, so it might equally well be rendered:
</p><blockquote><p>1. Visito</p><blockquote><p>1a. Veni</p><p>1b. Vidi</p><p>1c. Vici
</p></blockquote></blockquote><p /><p>or even:
</p><blockquote><p>A: Visito</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Veni</p><p>&nbsp;(ii) Vidi</p><p>(iii) Vici
</p></blockquote></blockquote><p /><p>Alternatively, if the first word of the item consists of a single <code>#</code>
character, the item is treated as having a <code>:numbered</code> option:
</p><pre><code>     =item1  # Visito
     =item2     # Veni
     =item2     # Vidi
     =item2     # Vici
</code></pre><p /><p>To specify an <em>unnumbered</em> list item that starts with a literal <code>#</code>, either
make the octothorpe verbatim:
</p><pre><code>    =item <strong>V&lt;#&gt;</strong> introduces a comment
</code></pre><p /><p>or explicitly mark the item itself as being unnumbered:
</p><pre><code>    =for item <strong>:!numbered</strong>
    # introduces a comment
</code></pre><p /><p>The numbering of successive <code>=item1</code> list items increments
automatically, but is reset to 1 whenever any other kind of non-ambient
Pod block appears between two <code>=item1</code> blocks. For example:
</p><pre><code>    The options are:

    =item1 # Liberty
    =item1 # Death
    =item1 # Beer

    The tools are:

    =item1 # Revolution
    =item1 # Deep-fried peanut butter sandwich
    =item1 # Keg
</code></pre><p /><p>would produce:
</p><blockquote><p>The options are:</p><blockquote><p>1. Liberty
</p><p>2. Death
</p><p>3. Beer
</p></blockquote><p>
The tools are:</p><blockquote><p>1. Revolution
</p><p>2. Deep-fried peanut butter sandwich
</p><p>3. Keg
</p></blockquote></blockquote><p /><p>The numbering of nested items (<code>=item2</code>, <code>=item3</code>, etc.) only resets
(to 1) when the higher-level item's numbering either resets or increments.
</p><p>To prevent a numbered <code>=item1</code> from resetting after a non-item block,
you can specify the <code>:continued</code> option:
</p><pre><code>     =for item1
     # Retreat to remote Himalayan monastery

     =for item1
     # Learn the hidden mysteries of space and time

     I&lt;????&gt;

     =for item1 <strong>:continued</strong>
     # Prophet!
</code></pre><p /><p>which produces:
</p><blockquote><p>1. Retreat to remote Himalayan monastery
</p><p>2. Learn the hidden mysteries of space and time
</p><p><em>????</em>
</p><p>3. Prophet!
</p></blockquote><h4>Unordered lists
</h4><p>List items that are not <code>:numbered</code> are treated as defining unordered
lists. Typically, such lists are rendered with bullets. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =item1 Reading
    =item2 Writing
    =item3 'Rithmetic
</code></pre><p /><p>might be rendered:
</p><blockquote><p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading
</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing
</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>&curren;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Rithmetic
</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>As with numbering styles, the bulleting strategy used for different levels
within a nested list is entirely up to the renderer.
</p><h4>Multi-paragraph list items
</h4><p>Use the delimited form of the <code>=item</code> block to specify items that
contain multiple paragraphs. For example:
</p><pre><code>     Let's consider two common proverbs:

     =begin item :numbered
     I&lt;The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.&gt;

     This is a common myth and an unconscionable slur on the Spanish
     people, the majority of whom are extremely attractive.
     =end item

     =begin item :numbered
     I&lt;The early bird gets the worm.&gt;

     In deciding whether to become an early riser, it is worth
     considering whether you would actually enjoy annelids
     for breakfast.
     =end item

     As you can see, folk wisdom is often of dubious value.
</code></pre><p /><p>which produces:
</p><blockquote><p>Let's consider two common proverbs:</p><ol><li value='1'><p><em>The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.</em></p><p>This is a common myth and an unconscionable slur on the Spanish
people, the majority of whom are extremely attractive.
</p></li></ol><p>
</p><ol><li value='2'><p><em>The early bird gets the worm.</em></p><p>In deciding whether to become an early riser, it is worth
considering whether you would actually enjoy annelids
for breakfast.
</p></li></ol><p>
As you can see, folk wisdom is often of dubious value.
</p></blockquote><h4>Definition lists
</h4><p>To create term/definition lists, use a <code>=defn</code> block. This is
similar in effect to an <code>=item</code> block, in that a series of <code>=defn</code>
blocks implicitly defines a list (but which might then be rendered into
HTML using C«&lt;DL&gt;...&lt;/DL&gt;» tags, rather than C«&lt;UL&gt;...&lt;/UL&gt;» tags)
</p><p>The first non-blank line of content is treated as a term being defined,
and the remaining content is treated as the definition for the term.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    =defn  MAD
    Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence.

    =defn  MEEKNESS
    Uncommon patience in planning a revenge that is worth while.

    =defn
    MORAL
    Conforming to a local and mutable standard of right.
    Having the quality of general expediency.
</code></pre><p /><p>Like other kinds of list items, definitions can be numbered, using either an
option or a leading <code>#</code>:
</p><pre><code>    =for defn <strong>:numbered</strong>
    SELFISH
    Devoid of consideration for the selfishness of others.

    =defn <strong>#</strong> SUCCESS
    The one unpardonable sin against one's fellows.
</code></pre><h3>Nesting blocks
</h3><p>Any block can be nested by specifying a <code>:nested</code> option on it:
</p><pre><code>    =begin para <strong>:nested</strong>
        We are all of us in the gutter,E&lt;NL&gt;
        but some of us are looking at the stars!
    =end para
</code></pre><p /><p>However, qualifying each nested paragraph individually quickly becomes
tedious if there are many in a sequence, or if multiple levels of
nesting are required:
</p><pre><code>    =begin para <strong>:nested</strong>
        We are all of us in the gutter,E&lt;NL&gt;
        but some of us are looking at the stars!
    =end para
    =begin para <strong>:nested(2)</strong>
            -- Oscar Wilde
    =end para
</code></pre><p /><p>So Pod provides a <code>=nested</code> block that marks all its contents as being
nested:
</p><pre><code>    <strong>=begin nested</strong>
    We are all of us in the gutter,E&lt;NL&gt;
    but some of us are looking at the stars!
        <strong>=begin nested</strong>
        -- Oscar Wilde
        <strong>=end nested</strong>
    <strong>=end nested</strong>
</code></pre><p /><p>Nesting blocks can contain any other kind of block, including implicit
paragraph and code blocks. Note that the relative physical indentation
of the blocks plays no role in determining their ultimate nesting.
The preceding example could equally have been specified:
</p><pre><code>    <strong>=begin nested</strong>
    We are all of us in the gutter,E&lt;NL&gt;
    but some of us are looking at the stars!
    <strong>=begin nested</strong>
    -- Oscar Wilde
    <strong>=end nested</strong>
    <strong>=end nested</strong>
</code></pre><h3>Tables
</h3><p>Simple tables can be specified in Pod using a <code>=table</code> block.
The table may be given an associated description or title using the
<code>:caption</code> option.
</p><p>Columns are separated by two or more consecutive whitespace characters,
or by a vertical line (<code>|</code>) or a border intersection (<code>+</code>), either of
which must be separated from any content by at least one whitespace
character.
</p><p>Rows can be specified in one of two ways: either one row per line, with
no separators; or multiple lines per row with explicit horizontal
separators (whitespace, intersections (<code>+</code>), or horizontal lines: <code>-</code>,
<code>=</code>, <code>_</code>) between <em>every</em> row. Either style can also have an
explicitly separated header row at the top.
</p><p>Each individual table cell is separately formatted, as if it were a
nested <code>=para</code>.
</p><p>This means you can create tables compactly, line-by-line:
</p><pre><code>    =table
        The Shoveller   Eddie Stevens     King Arthur's singing shovel
        Blue Raja       Geoffrey Smith    Master of cutlery
        Mr Furious      Roy Orson         Ticking time bomb of fury
        The Bowler      Carol Pinnsler    Haunted bowling ball
</code></pre><p /><p>or line-by-line with multi-line headers:
</p><pre><code>    =table
        Superhero     | Secret          |
                      | Identity        | Superpower
        ==============|=================|================================
        The Shoveller | Eddie Stevens   | King Arthur's singing shovel
        Blue Raja     | Geoffrey Smith  | Master of cutlery
        Mr Furious    | Roy Orson       | Ticking time bomb of fury
        The Bowler    | Carol Pinnsler  | Haunted bowling ball
</code></pre><p /><p>or with multi-line headers <em>and</em> multi-line data:
</p><pre><code>    =begin table :caption('The Other Guys')

                        Secret
        Superhero       Identity          Superpower
        =============   ===============   ===================
        The Shoveller   Eddie Stevens     King Arthur's
                                          singing shovel

        Blue Raja       Geoffrey Smith    Master of cutlery

        Mr Furious      Roy Orson         Ticking time bomb
                                          of fury

        The Bowler      Carol Pinnsler    Haunted bowling ball

    =end table
</code></pre><h3>Named blocks
</h3><p>Blocks whose names contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase
letter are assumed to be destined for specialized renderers or parser
plug-ins. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =begin Xhtml
    &lt;object type="video/quicktime" data="onion.mov"&gt;
    =end Xhtml
</code></pre><p /><p>or:
</p><pre><code>    =Image http://www.perlfoundation.org/images/perl_logo_32x104.png
</code></pre><p /><p>Named blocks are converted by the Pod parser to block objects;
specifically, to objects of a subclass of the standard
<code>Pod6::Block::Named</code> class.
</p><p>For example, the blocks of the previous example would be converted to
objects of the classes <code>Pod6::Block::Named::Xhtml</code> and
<code>Pod6::Block::Named::Image</code> respectively. Both of those classes
would be automatically created as subclasses of the
<code>Pod6::Block::Named</code> class (unless they were already defined in a module
loaded via some prior <a href='#How Pod is parsed and processed'><code>DOC use</code></a>.
</p><p>The resulting object's <code>.typename</code> method retrieves the short name of
the block type: <code>'Xhtml'</code>, <code>'Image'</code>, etc. The object's <code>.config</code>
method retrieves the list of configuration options (if any). The
object's <code>.contents</code> method retrieves a list of the block's
verbatim contents.
</p><p>Named blocks for which no explicit class has been defined or loaded are
usually not rendered by the standard renderers.
</p><p>Note that all block names consisting entirely of lowercase or entirely of
uppercase letters are reserved. See <a href='#Semantic blocks'>#Semantic blocks</a>.
</p><h3>Pod comments
</h3><p>All Pod blocks are intrinsically Perl 6 comments, but
<dfn>Pod comments</dfn> are comments that Pod renderers ignore too.
That is, they are Pod blocks that are never to be rendered by any
renderer. They are, of course, still included in any internal Pod
representation, and are accessible via the Pod API...and via the
<code>$=POD</code> variable within a Perl 6 program.
</p><p>Comments are useful for meta-documentation (documenting the documentation):
</p><pre><code>    =comment Add more here about the algorithm
</code></pre><p /><p>and for temporarily removing parts of a document:
</p><pre><code>    =item # Retreat to remote Himalayan monastery

    =item # Learn the hidden mysteries of space and time

    =item # Achieve enlightenment

    <strong>=begin comment</strong>
    =item # Prophet!
    <strong>=end comment</strong>
</code></pre><p /><p>Note that, since the Perl interpreter never executes embedded Pod
blocks, <code>comment</code> blocks can also be used as an alternative form of
nestable block comments in Perl 6:
</p><pre><code>    =begin comment
    for my $file (@files) {
        system("rm -rf $file");
    }
    =end comment
</code></pre><h3>The <code>=END</code> block
</h3><p>The <code>=END</code> block is special in that all three of its forms
(<a href='#Delimited blocks'>delimited</a>, <a href='#Paragraph blocks'>paragraph</a>, and
<a href='#Abbreviated blocks'>abbreviated</a>) are terminated only by the end of the
current file. That is, neither <code>=END</code> nor <code>=for END</code> are terminated by the
next blank line, and <code>=end END</code> has no effect within a <code>=begin END</code> block.
A warning is issued if an explicit <code>=end END</code> appears within a document.
</p><p>An <code>=END</code> block indicates the end-point of any ambient material within
the document. This means that the parser will treat all the remaining
text in the file as Pod, even if it is not inside an explicit block. In
other words, apart from its special end-of-file termination behaviour,
an <code>=END</code> block is in all other respects identical to a <code>=pod</code> block.
</p><h3>Data blocks
</h3><p>Named Pod blocks whose typename is <code>DATA</code> are the Perl 6 equivalent of
the Perl 5 <code>__DATA__</code> section. The difference is that <code>=DATA</code> blocks are
just regular Pod blocks and may appear anywhere within a source file, and as
many times as required. Synopsis 2 describes the new Perl 6 interface
for accessing inline data of this type.
</p><p><code>=DATA</code> blocks are never rendered by the standard Pod renderers.
</p><h3>Semantic blocks
</h3><p>All uppercase block typenames except <code>=END</code> and <code>=DATA</code> are reserved
for specifying standard documentation, publishing, or source components.
In particular, all the standard components found in Perl and manpage
documentation have reserved uppercase typenames.
</p><p>Standard semantic blocks include:
</p><pre><code>    =NAME
    =VERSION
    =SYNOPSIS
    =DESCRIPTION
    =USAGE
    =INTERFACE
    =METHOD
    =SUBROUTINE
    =OPTION
    =DIAGNOSTIC
    =ERROR
    =WARNING
    =DEPENDENCY
    =BUG
    =SEE-ALSO
    =ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
    =AUTHOR
    =COPYRIGHT
    =DISCLAIMER
    =LICENCE
    =LICENSE
    =TITLE
    =SECTION
    =CHAPTER
    =APPENDIX
    =TOC
    =INDEX
    =FOREWORD
    =SUMMARY
</code></pre><p /><p>The plural forms of each of these keywords are also reserved, and are
aliases for the singular forms.
</p><p>Most of these blocks would typically be used in their full delimited forms:
</p><pre><code>    =begin SYNOPSIS
        use Magic::Parser

        my Magic::Parser $parser .= new();

        my $tree = $parser.parse($fh);
    =end SYNOPSIS
</code></pre><p /><p>Semantic blocks can be considered to be variants of the <code>=head1</code> block
in most respects (and most renderers will treat them as such). The main
difference is that, in a <code>=head1</code> block, the heading is the contents of
the block; whereas, in a semantic block, the heading is derived from the
typename of the block itself and the block contents are instead treated as
the <code>=para</code> or <code>=code</code> block(s) belonging to the heading.
</p><p>The use of these special blocks is not required; you can still just write:
</p><pre><code>    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    =begin code
        use Magic::Parser

        my Magic::Parser $parser .= new();

        my $tree = $parser.parse($fh);
    =end code
</code></pre><p /><p>However, using the keywords adds semantic information to the
documentation, which may assist various renderers, summarizers, coverage
tools, document refactorers, and other utilities. This is because a
semantic block <em>encloses</em> the text it controls (unlike a <code>=head1</code>,
which merely precedes its corresponding text), so using semantic blocks
produces a more explicitly structured document.
</p><p>Note that there is no requirement that semantic blocks be rendered in
a particular way (or at all). Specifically, it is not necessary to
preserve the capitalization of the keyword. For example, the
<code>=SYNOPSIS</code> block of the preceding example might be rendered like so:
</p><blockquote><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Synopsis</em></strong></p><pre><code>    use Perl6::Magic::Parser;

    my $rep = Perl6::Magic::Parser.parse($fh, :all_pod);
</code></pre></blockquote><h2>Formatting codes
</h2><p>Formatting codes provide a way to add inline mark-up to a piece of text
within the contents of (most types of) Pod block (including all
<a href='#Declarator blocks'>declarator blocks</a>). Formatting codes are
themselves a type of block, and may nest other formatting codes.
other type of block (most often, other formatting codes). In particular,
you can nest comment blocks in the middle of a formatting code:
</p><pre><code>    <code>B</code>&lt;I shall say this loudly
    <strong>Z&lt;and repeatedly&gt;</strong>
    and with emphasis.&gt;
</code></pre><p /><p>All Pod formatting codes consist of a single capital letter followed
immediately by a set of angle brackets. The brackets contain the text or
data to which the formatting code applies. You can use a set of single
angles (C«&lt;...&gt;»), a set of double angles (<code>«...»</code>), or multiple
single-angles (C«&lt;&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;&gt;»).
</p><p>Within angle delimiters, you cannot use sequences of the same angle
characters that are longer than the delimiters:
</p><pre><code>    =comment
        These are errors...

    C&lt; $fooB«&lt;&lt;»barB«&gt;&gt;» &gt;
    The Perl 5 heredoc syntax was: C&lt; B«&lt;&lt;»END_MARKER &gt;
</code></pre><p /><p>You <em>can</em> use sequences of angles that are the same length as
the delimiters, but they must be balanced. For example:
</p><pre><code>    C&lt;  $foo&lt;bar&gt;   &gt;
    C&lt;&lt; $foo&lt;&lt;bar&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</code></pre><p>If you need an unbalanced angle, either use different delimiters:
</p><pre><code>    C<strong>«</strong>$foo &lt; $bar<strong>»</strong>
    The Perl 5 heredoc syntax was: C<strong>«</strong> &lt;&lt;END_MARKER <strong>»</strong>
</code></pre><p /><p>or delimiters with more consecutive angles than your text contains:
</p><pre><code>    CB«&lt;&lt;»$foo &lt; $barB«&gt;&gt;»
    The Perl 5 heredoc syntax was: CB«&lt;&lt;&lt;» &lt;&lt;END_MARKER B«&gt;&gt;&gt;»
</code></pre><p /><p>A formatting code ends at the matching closing angle bracket(s), or at
the end of the enclosing block or formatting code in which the opening
angle bracket was specified, whichever comes first (this includes paragraph
and abbreviated blocks, ending with blank a line). Pod parsers are
required to issue a warning whenever a formatting code is terminated by
the end of an outer block rather than by its own delimiter (unless the
user explicitly disables the warning).
</p><h3>Significance indicators
</h3><p>Pod provides three formatting codes that flag their contents with
increasing levels of significance:
</p><ul><li>The <code>U&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is
<strong>unusual</strong> or distinctive; that it is of <em>minor significance</em>. Typically
such content would be rendered in an underlined style.
</li><li>The <code>I&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is
<strong>important</strong>; that it is of <em>major significance</em>. Such content would
typically be rendered in italics or in <code> &lt;em</code>...&lt;em/&gt; &gt; tags
</li><li>The <code>B&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is the
<strong>basis</strong> or focus of the surrounding text; that it is of <em>fundamental
significance</em>. Such content would typically be rendered in a bold style or
in <code> &lt;strong</code>...&lt;/strong&gt; &gt; tags.
</li></ul><h3>Definitions
</h3><p>The <code>D&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code indicates that the contained text is a
<strong>definition</strong>, introducing a term that the adjacent text
elucidates. It is the inline equivalent of a <code>=defn</code> block.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    There ensued a terrible moment of <strong>D&lt;coyotus interruptus&gt;</strong>: a brief
    suspension of the effects of gravity, accompanied by a sudden
    to-the-camera realisation of imminent downwards acceleration.
</code></pre><p /><p>A definition may be given synonyms, which are specified after a vertical bar
and separated by semicolons:
</p><pre><code>    A <strong>D&lt;formatting code|formatting codes;formatters&gt;</strong> provides a way
    to add inline mark-up to a piece of text.
</code></pre><p /><p>A definition would typically be rendered in italics or <code> &lt;dfn</code>...&lt;/dfn&gt; &gt;
tags and will often be used as a link target for subsequent instances of the
term (or any of its specified synonyms) within a hypertext.
</p><h3>Example specifiers
</h3><p>Pod provides formatting codes for specifying inline examples of input,
output, code, and metasyntax:
</p><ul><li>The <code>T&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is
<strong>terminal output</strong>; that is: something that a program might print out.
Such content would typically be rendered in a <samp>fixed-width font</samp> or with
<code> &lt;samp</code>...&lt;/samp&gt; &gt; tags. The contents of a <code>T&lt;&gt;</code> code are always
<a href='#Space-preserving text'>space-preserved</a> (as if they had an implicit
<code>S&lt;...&gt;</code> around them). The <code>T&lt;&gt;</code> code is the inline equivalent of the
<code>=output</code> block.
</li><li>The <code>K&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is
<strong>keyboard input</strong>; that is: something that a user might type in. Such
content would typically be rendered in a <kbd>fixed-width font</kbd> (preferably a
different font from that used for the <code>T&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code) or with
<code> &lt;kbd</code>...&lt;/kbd&gt; &gt; tags. The contents of a <code>K&lt;&gt;</code> code are always
<a href='#Space-preserving text'>space-preserved</a>. The <code>K&lt;&gt;</code> code is the
inline equivalent of the <code>=input</code> block.
</li><li><p>The <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is <strong>code</strong>;
that is, something that might appear in a program or specification. Such
content would typically be rendered in a <code>fixed-width font</code> (preferably
a different font from that used for the <code>T&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>K&lt;&gt;</code> formatting
codes) or with <code> &lt;code</code>...&lt;/code&gt; &gt; tags. The contents of a <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> code
are <a href='#Space-preserving text'>space-preserved</a> and <a href='#Verbatim text'>verbatim</a>.
The <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> code is the inline equivalent of the <code>=code</code> block.</p><p>To include other formatting codes in a <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> code, you can lexically
<a href='#Block pre-configuration'>reconfigure</a> it:</p></li><pre><code>    =begin para
    <strong>=config C&lt;&gt; :allow&lt;E I</strong>&gt;
    Perl 6 makes extensive use of the C&lt;B&lt;E&lt;laquo&gt;&gt;&gt; and C&lt;B&lt;E&lt;raquo&gt;&gt;&gt;
    characters, for example, in a hash look-up:
    C&lt;%hashB&lt;I&lt;E&lt;laquo&gt;&gt;&gt;keyB&lt;I&lt;E&lt;raquo&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
    =end para
</code></pre><li>
To enable entities in <em>every</em> <code>C&lt;...&gt;</code> put a <code>=config C&lt;&gt; :allow&lt;E</code>&gt;
at the top of the document
</li><li>The <code>R&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code specifies that the contained text is a
<strong>replaceable item</strong>, a placeholder, or a metasyntactic variable. It is
used to indicate a component of a syntax or specification that should
eventually be replaced by an actual value. For example:

</li><pre><code>    The basic C&lt;ln&gt; command is: C&lt;ln&gt; <strong>R&lt;source_file&gt; R&lt;target_file&gt;</strong>
</code></pre><li>
or:

</li><pre><code>    Then enter your details at the prompt:

    =for input
        Name: <strong>R&lt;your surname&gt;</strong>
          ID: <strong>R&lt;your employee number&gt;</strong>
        Pass: <strong>R&lt;your 36-letter password&gt;</strong>
</code></pre><li>
Typically replaceables would be rendered in <var>fixed-width italics</var> or with
<code> &lt;var</code>...&lt;/var&gt; &gt; tags. The font used should be the same as that used for
the <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> code, unless the <code>R&lt;&gt;</code> is inside a <code>K&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>T&lt;&gt;</code> code (or
the equivalent <code>=input</code> or <code>=output</code> blocks), in which case their
respective fonts should be used.
</li></ul><h3>Verbatim text
</h3><p>The <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code treats its entire contents as being <strong>verbatim</strong>,
disregarding every apparent formatting code within it. For example:
</p><pre><code>    The B&lt;V&lt; V&lt;&gt; &gt;&gt; formatting code disarms other codes
    such as V&lt; I&lt;&gt;, C&lt;&gt;, B&lt;&gt;, and M&lt;&gt; &gt;.
</code></pre><p>Note, however that the <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> code only changes the way its
contents are parsed, <em>not</em> the way they are rendered. That is, the
contents are still wrapped and formatted like plain text, and the
effects of any formatting codes surrounding the <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> code
are still applied to its contents. For example the previous example
is rendered:
</p><blockquote><p>The <strong><code> <code /> </code></strong> formatting code disarms other codes
such as <code> <em />, <code />, <strong />, and <M /> </code>.
</p></blockquote><p>You can prespecify formatting codes that remain active within
a <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> code, using the <a href='#Formatting within code blocks'><code>:allow</code></a>
option.
</p><h3>Inline comments
</h3><p>The <code>Z&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code indicates that its contents constitute a
<strong>zero-width comment</strong>, which should not be rendered by any renderer.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    The "exeunt" command <strong>Z&lt;Think about renaming this command?&gt;</strong> is used
    to quit all applications.
</code></pre><p /><p>In Perl 5 POD, the <code>Z&lt;&gt;</code> code was widely used to break up text that would
otherwise be considered mark-up:
</p><pre><code>    In Perl 5 POD, the Z<strong>Z&lt;&gt;</strong>&lt;&gt; code was widely used to break up text
    that would otherwise be considered mark-up.
</code></pre><p /><p>That technique still works, but it's now easier to accomplish the same goal
using a verbatim formatting code:
</p><pre><code>    In Perl 5 POD, the B«V&lt;V&lt;Z&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;» code was widely used to break up text
    that would otherwise be considered mark-up.
</code></pre><p /><p>Moreover, the <code>C&lt;&gt;</code> code automatically treats its contents as being
verbatim, which often eliminates the need for the <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> as well:
</p><pre><code>    In Perl 5 POD, the B«V&lt;C&lt;Z&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;» code was widely used to break up text
    that would otherwise be considered mark-up.
</code></pre><p /><p>The <code>Z&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code is the inline equivalent of a
<a href='#Comments'><code>=comment</code> block</a>.
</p><h4>Comments as category markers
</h4><p>Most Pod renderers will provide a mechanism that allows particular Pod
blocks to be explicitly excluded or included if they match a particular
pattern. For example, a renderer might be instructed to omit any block
that contains the pattern <code>/CONFIDENTIAL/</code>. Corresponding "invisibility
markers" can then be placed inside <code>Z&lt;&gt;</code> comments within any block that
should not normally be displayed. For example:
</p><pre><code>    class Widget is Bauble
    {
        has $.things; #= a collection of other stuff
        #={ Z&lt;CONFIDENTIAL&gt;
            This variable needs to be replaced for political reasons
        }
    }
</code></pre><h3>Links
</h3><p>The <code>L&lt;&gt;</code> code is used to specify all kinds of links, filenames, citations,
and cross-references (both internal and external).
</p><p>A link specification consists of a <em>scheme specifier</em> terminated by a
colon, followed by an <em>external address</em> (in the scheme's preferred
syntax), followed by an <em>internal address</em> (again, in the scheme's syntax).
All three components are optional, though at least one must be present in
any link specification.
</p><p>Usually, in schemes where an internal address makes sense, it will be
separated from the preceding external address by a <code>#</code>, unless the
particular addressing scheme requires some other syntax. When new
addressing schemes are created specifically for Pod it is strongly
recommended that <code>#</code> be used to mark the start of internal addresses.
</p><p>Standard schemes include:
</p><dl><dt><strong><code>http:</code> and <code>https:</code></strong></dt><dd>
A standard web URL. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    This module needs the LAME library
    (available from L&lt;B&lt;http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/&gt;&gt;)
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>If the link does not start with <code>//</code> it is treated as being relative to
the location of the current document:

</dd><pre><code>    See also: L&lt;B&lt;http:tutorial/faq.html&gt;&gt; and
    L&lt;B&lt;http:../examples/index.html&gt;&gt;
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>file:</code></strong></dt><dd>
A filename on the local system. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    Next, edit the global config file (that is, either
    L&lt;B&lt;file:/usr/local/lib/.configrc&gt;&gt; or L&lt;B&lt;file:~/.configrc&gt;&gt;).
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>Filenames that don't begin with a <code>/</code> or a <code>~</code> are relative
to the current document's location:

</dd><pre><code>    Then, edit the local config file (that is, either
    L&lt;B&lt;file:.configrc&gt;&gt; or L&lt;B&lt;file:CONFIG/.configrc&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>mailto:</code></strong></dt><dd>
An email address. Typically, activating this type of link invokes a mailer.
For example:

</dd><pre><code>    Please forward bug reports to L&lt;B&lt;mailto:devnull@rt.cpan.org&gt;&gt;
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>man:</code></strong></dt><dd>
A link to the system manpages. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    This module implements the standard
    Unix L&lt;B&lt;man:find(1)&gt;&gt; facilities.
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>doc:</code></strong></dt><dd>
A link to some other documentation, typically a module or part of the
core documentation; things that would normally be read with <code>perl --doc</code>.
For example:

</dd><pre><code>    You may wish to use L&lt;B&lt;doc:Data::Dumper&gt;&gt; to
    view the results. See also: L&lt;B&lt;doc:perldata&gt;&gt;.
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>defn:</code></strong></dt><dd>
A link to the <a href='#Definition lists'>block-form</a> or <a href='#Definitions'>inline</a>
definition of the specified term within the current document. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    He was highly prone to <strong>D&lt;lexiphania&gt;</strong>: an unfortunate proclivity
    for employing grandiloquisms (for example, words such as "proclivity",
    "grandiloquism", and indeed "lexiphania").

    <strong>=defn glossoligation</strong>
    Restraint of the tongue (voluntary or otherwise)
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>and later, to link back to the definition

</dd><pre><code>To treat his chronic L&lt;B&lt;defn:lexiphania&gt;&gt; the doctor prescribed an
immediate L&lt;B&lt;defn:glossoligation&gt;&gt; or, if that proved ineffective,
a complete cephalectomy.
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd><dt><strong><code>isbn:</code> and <code>issn:</code></strong></dt><dd>
The International Standard Book Number or International Standard
Serial Number for a publication. For example:

</dd><pre><code>    The Perl Journal was a registered
    serial publication (L&lt;B&lt;issn:1087-903X&gt;&gt;)
</code></pre><dt><strong /></dt><dd>
</dd></dl><p /><p>To refer to a specific section within a webpage, manpage, or Pod
document, add the name of that section after the main link, separated by
a <code>#</code>. For example:
</p><pre><code>    Also see: L&lt;man:bash(1)B&lt;#Compound Commands&gt;&gt;,
    L&lt;doc:perlsynB&lt;#For Loops&gt;&gt;, and
    L&lt;http://dev.perl.org/perl6/syn/S04.htmlB&lt;#The_for_statement&gt;&gt;
</code></pre><p /><p>To refer to a section of the current document, omit the external address:
</p><pre><code>    This mechanism is described under L&lt;doc:B&lt;#Special Features&gt;&gt; below.
</code></pre><p /><p>The scheme name may also be omitted in that case:
</p><pre><code>    This mechanism is described under L&lt;B&lt;#Special Features&gt;&gt; below.
</code></pre><p /><p>Normally a link is presented as some rendered version of the link
specification itself. However, you can specify an alternate
presentation by prefixing the link with the desired text and a
vertical bar. Whitespace is not significant on either side of the bar.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    This module needs the L&lt;B&lt;LAME library|&gt;http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/&gt;.

    You could also write the code
    L&lt;B&lt;in Latin |&gt; doc:Lingua::Romana::Perligata&gt;

    His L&lt;B&lt;lexiphanic|&gt;defn:lexiphania&gt;&gt; tendencies were, alas, incurable.
</code></pre><h3>Placement links
</h3><p>A second kind of link&mdash;the <code>P&lt;&gt;</code> or <strong>placement link</strong>&mdash;works
in the opposite direction. Instead of directing focus out to another
document, it allows you to assimilate the contents of another document
into your own.
</p><p>In other words, the <code>P&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code takes a URI and (where possible)
inserts the contents of the corresponding document inline in place of the
code itself.
</p><p><code>P&lt;&gt;</code> codes are handy for breaking out standard elements of
your documentation set into reusable components that can then be
incorporated directly into multiple documents. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =COPYRIGHT
    P&lt;file:/shared/docs/std_copyright.pod&gt;
</code></pre><pre><code>    =DISCLAIMER
    P&lt;http://www.MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp.com/std/disclaimer.txt&gt;
</code></pre><p>might produce:
</p><blockquote><p><strong>Copyright</strong></p><p>This document is copyright (c) MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp, 2006. All rights reserved.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY IS IMPLIED. NOT EVEN OF ANY KIND. WE HAVE SOLD
YOU THIS SOFTWARE WITH NO HINT OF A SUGGESTION THAT IT IS EITHER USEFUL
OR USABLE. AS FOR GUARANTEES OF CORRECTNESS...DON'T MAKE US LAUGH! AT
SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE WE MIGHT DEIGN TO SELL YOU UPGRADES THAT PURPORT
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE APPLICATION'S MANY DEFICIENCIES, BUT NO PROMISES
THERE EITHER. WE HAVE MORE LAWYERS ON STAFF THAN YOU HAVE TOTAL
EMPLOYEES, SO DON'T EVEN *THINK* ABOUT SUING US. HAVE A NICE DAY.
</p></blockquote><p /><p>If a renderer cannot find or access the external data source for a
placement link, it must issue a warning and render the URI directly in
some form, possibly as an outwards link. For example:
</p><blockquote><p><strong>Copyright</strong></p><p>See: std_copyright.pod</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>See: <a href='http://www.MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp.com/std/disclaimer.txt'>http://www.MegaGigaTeraPetaCorp.com/std/disclaimer.txt</a>
</p></blockquote><p /><p>You can use any of the following URI forms (see <a href='#Links'>#Links</a>) in a
placement link:
</p><ul><li><code>http:</code> and <code>https:</code>
</li><li><code>file:</code>
</li><li><code>man:</code>
</li><li><code>doc:</code>
</li><li><code>toc:</code>
</li></ul><p>The <code>toc:</code> form is a special pseudo-scheme that inserts a table of contents
in place of the <code>P&lt;&gt;</code> code. After the colon, list the block types that you
wish to include in the table of contents. For example, to place a table of
contents listing only top- and second-level headings:
</p><pre><code>    P&lt;toc: head1 head2&gt;
</code></pre><p>To place a table of contents that lists the top four levels of headings, as
well as any tables:
</p><pre><code>    P&lt;toc: head1 head2 head3 head4 table&gt;
</code></pre><p>To place a table of diagrams (assuming a user-defined <code>Diagram</code> block):
</p><pre><code>    P&lt;toc: Diagram&gt;
</code></pre><p>Note also that, for <code>P&lt;toc:...&gt;</code>, all <a href='#Semantic'>semantic blocks</a> are treated as equivalent to <code>head1</code> headings, and the
<code>=item1</code>/<code>=item</code> equivalence is preserved.
</p><p>A document may have as many <code>P&lt;toc:...&gt;</code> placements as necessary.
</p><h3>Alias placements
</h3><p>A variation on placement codes is the <code>A&lt;&gt;</code> code, which is replaced
by the contents of the named alias or object specified within its delimiters.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    =alias PROGNAME    Earl Irradiatem Eventually
    =alias VENDOR      4D Kingdoms
    =alias TERMS_URL   L&lt;http://www.4dk.com/eie&gt;

    The use of A&lt;PROGNAME&gt; is subject to the terms and conditions
    laid out by A&lt;VENDOR&gt;, as specified at A&lt;TERMS_URL&gt;.
</code></pre><p /><p>Any compile-time Perl 6 object that starts with a sigil is automatically
available within an alias placement as well. Unless the object is already
a string type, it is converted to a string during document-generation by
implicitly calling <code>.perl</code> on it.
</p><p>So, for example, a document can refer to its own filename (as
<code>A&lt;$?FILE&gt;</code>), or to the subroutine inside which the specific Pod is nested
(as <code>A&lt;$?ROUTINE&gt;</code>), or to the current class (as <code>A&lt;$?CLASS&gt;</code>).
Similarly, the value of any program constants defined with sigils can be
easily reproduced in documentation:
</p><pre><code>    # Actual code...
    constant $GROWTH_RATE of Num where 0..* = 1.6;
</code></pre><pre><code>    =pod
    =head4 Standard Growth Rate
</code></pre><pre><code>    The standard growth rate is assumed to be A&lt;$GROWTH_RATE&gt;.
</code></pre><p>Non-mutating method calls on these objects are also allowed, so a
document can reproduce the surrounding subroutine's signature
(<code>A&lt;$?ROUTINE.signature&gt;</code>) or the type of a constant
(<code>A&lt;$GROWTH_RATE.WHAT&gt;</code>).
</p><p>See <a href='#Aliases'>#Aliases</a> for further details of the aliasing macro mechanism.
</p><h3>Space-preserving text
</h3><p>Any text enclosed in an <code>S&lt;&gt;</code> code is formatted normally, except that
every whitespace character in it&mdash;including any newline&mdash;is
preserved. These characters are also treated as being non-breaking
(except for the newlines, of course). For example:
</p><pre><code>    The emergency signal is: S&lt;
    dot dot dot   dash dash dash   dot dot dot&gt;.
</code></pre><p>would be formatted like so:
</p><blockquote><p>The emergency signal is:<br />
dot&nbsp;dot&nbsp;dot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dash&nbsp;dash&nbsp;dash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dot&nbsp;dot&nbsp;dot.
</p></blockquote><p>rather than:
</p><blockquote><p>The emergency signal is: dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot.
</p></blockquote><h3>Entities
</h3><p>To include Unicode code points or HTML5 character references in a
Pod document, specify the required <dfn>entity</dfn> using the <code>E&lt;&gt;</code> code.
</p><p>If the <code>E&lt;&gt;</code> contains a number, that number is treated as the decimal
Unicode value for the desired code point. For example:
</p><pre><code>    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;171&gt; and E&lt;187&gt;.
</code></pre><p>You can also use explicit binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal numbers
(using the Perl 6 notations for explicitly based numbers):
</p><pre><code>    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;0b10101011&gt; and E&lt;0b10111011&gt;.
    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;0o253&gt; and E&lt;0o273&gt;.
    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;0d171&gt; and E&lt;0d187&gt;.
    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;0xAB&gt; and E&lt;0xBB&gt;.
</code></pre><p>If the <code>E&lt;&gt;</code> contains anything that is not a number, the contents are
interpreted as a Unicode character name (which is always uppercase), or
else as an HTML5 named character reference. For example:
</p><pre><code>    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;LEFT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET&gt;
    and E&lt;RIGHT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET&gt;.
</code></pre><p>or, equivalently:
</p><pre><code>    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;laquo&gt; and E&lt;raquo&gt;.
</code></pre><p>Multiple consecutive entities (in any format) can be specified in a
single <code>E&lt;&gt;</code> code, separated by semicolons:
</p><pre><code>    Perl 6 makes considerable use of E&lt;LEFT DOUBLE ANGLE BRACKET;hellip;0xBB&gt;.
</code></pre><h3>Indexing terms
</h3><p>Anything enclosed in an <code>X&lt;&gt;</code> code is an <strong>index entry</strong>. The contents
of the code are both formatted into the document and used as the
(case-insensitive) index entry:
</p><pre><code>    An <strong>X&lt;array&gt;</strong> is an ordered list of scalars indexed by number,
    starting with 0. A <strong>X&lt;hash&gt;</strong> is an unordered collection of scalar
    values indexed by their associated string key.
</code></pre><p /><p>You can specify an index entry in which the indexed text and the index
entry are different, by separating the two with a vertical bar:
</p><pre><code>    An <strong>X&lt;array|arrays&gt;</strong> is an ordered list of scalars indexed by number,
    starting with 0. A <strong>X&lt;hash|hashes&gt;</strong> is an unordered collection of
    scalar values indexed by their associated string key.
</code></pre><p /><p>In the two-part form, the index entry comes after the bar and is
case-sensitive.
</p><p>You can specify hierarchical index entries by separating indexing levels
with commas:
</p><pre><code>    An X&lt;array|B&lt;arrays, definition of&gt;&gt; is an ordered list of scalars
    indexed by number, starting with 0. A X&lt;hash|B&lt;hashes, definition of&gt;&gt;
    is an unordered collection of scalar values indexed by their
    associated string key.
</code></pre><p /><p>You can specify two or more entries for a single indexed text, by separating
the entries with semicolons:
</p><pre><code>    A X&lt;hash|B&lt;hashes, definition of; associative arrays&gt;&gt;
    is an unordered collection of scalar values indexed by their
    associated string key.
</code></pre><p /><p>The indexed text can be empty, creating a "zero-width" index entry:
</p><pre><code>    <strong>X&lt;|puns, deliberate&gt;</strong>This is called the "Orcish Manoeuvre"
    because you "OR" the "cache".
</code></pre><h3>Annotations
</h3><p>Anything enclosed in an <code>N&lt;&gt;</code> code is an inline <strong>note</strong>.
For example:
</p><pre><code>    Use a C&lt;for&gt; loop instead.<strong>N&lt;The Perl 6 C&lt;for&gt; loop is far more
    powerful than its Perl 5 predecessor.&gt;</strong> Preferably with an explicit
    iterator variable.
</code></pre><p /><p>Renderers may render such annotations in a variety of ways: as
footnotes, as endnotes, as sidebars, as pop-ups, as tooltips, as
expandable tags, etc. They are never, however, rendered as unmarked
inline text. So the previous example might be rendered as:
</p><blockquote><p>Use a <code>for</code> loop instead.&dagger; Preferably with an explicit iterator
variable.
</p></blockquote><p>and later:
</p><blockquote><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>&dagger; The Perl 6 <code>for</code> loop is far more powerful than its Perl 5
predecessor.
</p></blockquote><h3>Module-defined formatting codes
</h3><p>Modules loaded with a <a href='#How Pod is parsed and processed'><code>DOC use</code></a>
can define classes that implement new formatting codes, which can
then be specified using the <code>M&lt;&gt;</code> code. An <code>M&lt;&gt;</code> code must start with
a colon-terminated scheme specifier. The rest of the enclosed text is
treated as the (verbatim) contents of the formatting code. For example:
</p><pre><code>    DOC use Pod6::TT;

    =head1 Overview of the <strong>M&lt;TT: $CLASSNAME &gt;</strong> class
    (version <strong>M&lt;TT: $VERSION&gt;</strong>)

    <strong>M&lt;TT: get_description($CLASSNAME) &gt;</strong>
</code></pre><p /><p>The <code>M&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code is the inline equivalent of a
<a href='#Named blocks'>named block</a>.
</p><p>Internally an <code>M&lt;&gt;</code> code is converted to an object derived from the
<code>Pod6::FormattingCode::Named</code> class. The name of the scheme becomes
the final component of the object's classname. For instance, the <code>M&lt;&gt;</code>
code in the previous example would be converted to a
<code>Pod6::FormattingCode::Named::TT</code> object, whose <code>.typename</code>
method retrieves the string <code>"TT"</code> and whose <code>.contents</code>
method retrieves a list of the formatting code's (verbatim,
unformatted) contents.
</p><p>If the formatting code is unrecognized, the contents of the code (i.e.
everything after the first colon) would normally be rendered as
ordinary text.
</p><h2>Encoding
</h2><p>By default, Pod assumes that documents are Unicode, encoded in one
of the three common schemes (UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32). The particular
scheme a document uses is autodiscovered by examination of the first few
bytes of the file (where possible). If the autodiscovery fails, UTF-8 is
assumed, and parsers may treat any non-UTF-8 bytes later in the
document as fatal errors.
</p><p>At any point in a document, you can explicitly set or change the encoding
of its content using the <code>=encoding</code> directive:
</p><pre><code>    =encoding ShiftJIS

    =encoding Macintosh

    =encoding KOI8-R
</code></pre><p /><p>The specified encoding is used from the start of the <em>next</em> line in
the document. If a second <code>=encoding</code> directive is encountered, the
current encoding changes again after that line. Note, however, that
the second encoding directive must itself be encoded using the first
encoding scheme.
</p><p>This requirement also applies to an <code>=encoding</code> directive at the very
beginning of the file. That is, it must itself be encoded in
the default UTF-8, -16, or -32. However, as a special case, the
autodiscovery mechanism will (as far as possible) also attempt to
recognize "self-encoded" <code>=encoding</code> directives that begin at the first
byte of the file. For example, at the start of a ShiftJIS-encoded file
you can specify <code>=encoding ShiftJIS</code> in the ShiftJIS encoding.
</p><p>An <code>=encoding</code> directive affects any ambient code between the Pod
as well. That is, Perl 6 uses <code>=encoding</code> directives to determine the
encoding of its source code as well as that of any documentation.
</p><p>Note that <code>=encoding</code> is a fundamental Pod directive, like <code>=begin</code> or
<code>=for</code>; it is <em>not</em> an instance of an <a href='#Abbreviated'>abbreviated block</a>. Hence there is no paragraph or delimited form of the <code>=encoding</code>
directive (just as there is no paragraph or delimited form of <code>=begin</code>).
</p><h2>Block pre-configuration
</h2><p>The <code>=config</code> directive allows you to prespecify standard configuration
information that is applied to every block of a particular type.
</p><p>For example, to specify particular formatting for different levels of
heading, you could preconfigure all the heading blocks with
appropriate formatting schemes:
</p><pre><code>    =config head1              :formatted&lt;B U&gt;  :numbered
    =config head2 :like&lt;head1&gt; :formatted&lt;I&gt;
    =config head3              :formatted&lt;U&gt;
    =config head4 :like&lt;head3&gt; :formatted&lt;I&gt;
</code></pre><p /><p>The general syntax for configuration directives is:
</p><pre><code>    =config <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>CONFIG OPTIONS</var>
    =                   <var>OPTIONAL EXTRA CONFIG OPTIONS</var>
</code></pre><p /><p>Like <code>=encoding</code>, a <code>=config</code> is a directive, not a block. Hence,
there is no paragraph or delimited form of the <code>=config</code> directive.
Each <code>=config</code> specification is lexically scoped to the surrounding
block in which it is specified.
</p><p>Note that, if a particular block later explicitly specifies a
configuration option with the same key, that option overrides the
pre-configured option. For example, given the heading configurations in the
previous example, to specify a <em>non</em>-basic second-level heading:
</p><pre><code>    =for head2 :formatted&lt;I U&gt;
    Details
</code></pre><p /><p>The <code>:like</code> option causes the current formatting options for the
named block type to be (lexically) <em>replaced</em> by the complete
formatting information of the block type specified as the <code>:like</code>'s
value. That other block type must already have been preconfigured. Any
additional formatting specifications are subsequently added to that
config. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =comment  In the current scope make =head2 an "important" variant of =head1
    =config head2 <strong>:like&lt;head1</strong>&gt; :formatted&lt;I&gt;
</code></pre><p /><p>Incidentally, this also means you can arrange for an explicit <code>:formatted</code>
option to <em>augment</em> an existing <code>=config</code>, rather than replacing
it. Like so:
</p><pre><code>    =comment  Mark this =head3 (but only this one) as being important
            (in addition to the normal formatting)...
    =head3 <strong>:like&lt;head3</strong>&gt; :formatted&lt;I&gt;
</code></pre><h3>Pre-configuring formatting codes
</h3><p>You can also lexically preconfigure a <a href='#Formatting codes'>formatting code</a>,
by naming it with a pair of angles as a suffix. For example:
</p><pre><code>    =comment  Always allow E&lt;&gt; codes in any (implicit or explicit) V&lt;&gt; code...
    <strong>=config V&lt;&gt;  :allow&lt;E</strong>&gt;
</code></pre><pre><code>    =comment  All inline code to be marked as important...
    <strong>=config C&lt;&gt;  :formatted&lt;I</strong>&gt;
</code></pre><p /><p>Note that, even though the formatting code is named using single-angles,
the preconfiguration applies regardless of the actual delimiters used on
subsequent instances of the code.
</p><h2>Aliases
</h2><p>The <code>=alias</code> directive provides a way to define lexically scoped
synonyms for longer Pod sequences, (meta)object declarators from the
code, or even entire chunks of ambient source. These synonyms can then
be inserted into subsequent Pod using the
<code>A&lt;&gt; formatting code</code>.
</p><p>Note that <code>=alias</code> is a fundamental Pod directive, like <code>=begin</code> or
<code>=for</code>; there are no equivalent paragraph or delimited forms.
</p><p>There are two forms of <code>=alias</code> directive: macro aliases and contextual
aliases. Both forms are lexically scoped to the surrounding Pod block.
</p><h3>Macro aliases
</h3><p>The simplest form of alias takes two arguments. The first is an
identifier (which is usually specified in uppercase, though this is
certainly not mandatory). The second argument consists of one or more
lines of replacement text.
</p><p>This creates a lexically scoped Perl 6 macro that can be invoked during
document generation by placing the identifier (i.e. the first argument
of the alias) in an <code>A&lt;&gt;</code> formatting code. This formatting code is then
replaced by the text returned by new macro.
</p><p>The replacement text returned by the alias macro begins at the first
non-whitespace character after the alias's identifier, and continues to
the end of the line. You can extend the replacement text over multiple
lines by starting the following line(s) with an <code>=</code> (at the same level
of indentation as the <code>=alias</code> directive itself) followed by at least
one whitespace. Each addition line of replacement text uses the original
line's (virtual) left margin, as specified by the indentation of the
replacement text on the <code>=alias</code> line.
</p><p>For example:
</p><pre><code>    =alias PROGNAME    Earl Irradiatem Evermore
    =alias VENDOR      4D Kingdoms
    =alias TERMS_URLS  =item L&lt;http://www.4dk.com/eie&gt;
    =                  =item L&lt;http://www.4dk.co.uk/eie.io/&gt;
    =                  =item L&lt;http://www.fordecay.ch/canttouchthis&gt;

    The use of A&lt;PROGNAME&gt; is subject to the terms and conditions
    laid out by A&lt;VENDOR&gt;, as specified at:

        A&lt;TERMS_URL&gt;

</code></pre><p /><p>would produce:
</p><blockquote><p>    The use of Earl Irradiatem Evermore is subject to the terms and
    conditions laid out by 4D Kingdoms Inc, as specified at:</p><p>        =item <a href='http://www.4dk.com/eie'>http://www.4dk.com/eie</a>
        =item <a href='http://www.4dk.co.uk/eie.io/'>http://www.4dk.co.uk/eie.io/</a>
        =item <a href='http://www.fordecay.ch/canttouchthis'>http://www.fordecay.ch/canttouchthis</a></p></blockquote><p /><p>The advantage of using aliases is, obviously, that the same alias can be
reused in multiple places in the documentation. Then, if the replacement
text ever has to be changed, it need only be modified in a single place:
</p><pre><code>    =alias PROGNAME    Count Krunchem Constantly
    =alias VENDOR      Last Chance Receivers Intl
    =alias TERMS_URLS  L&lt;http://www.c11.com/generic_conditions&gt;
</code></pre><h3>Contextual aliases
</h3><p>If the <code>=alias</code> directive is specified with only a single argument
(that is, with only its identifier), a <dfn>contextual alias</dfn> is created. In
this form, the <code>=alias</code> directive must be followed immediately (on the
next non-blank line) by ambient code.
</p><p>The single argument is then used as the name of the alias being created,
and some portion of the following code is used as the value returned by the
alias macro.
</p><p>Note that the code block following the <code>=alias</code> line is still treated
as real code by the Perl 6 parser, but its contents are <em>also</em> used to
create the replacement macro of the alias. This allows the developer to
reproduce chunks of actual source code directly in the documentation,
without having to copy it.
</p><p>If the code following the one-argument <code>=alias</code> directive begins with a
sequence of one or more repetitions of any opening bracket character,
the replacement macro returns a string containing everything from the
end of that opening sequence to just before the corresponding closing
bracket sequence. For example:
</p><pre><code>
    # This is actual code...

    sub hash_function ($key)
    =alias HASHCODE
    {
        my $hash = 0;
        for $key.split("") -&gt; $char {
            $hash = $hash*33 + $char.ord;
        }
        return $hash;
    }

    =begin pod
    An ancient (but fast) hashing algorithm is used:

        =begin code :allow&lt;A&gt;
        A&lt;HASHCODE&gt;
        =end code

    =end pod
</code></pre><p /><p>This would produce:
</p><blockquote><p>An ancient (but fast) hashing algorithm is used:</p><pre><code>    my $hash = 0;
    for $key.split("") -&gt; $char {
        $hash *= 33;
        $hash += $char.ord;
    }
    return $hash;</code></pre></blockquote><p /><p>Alternatively, if the <code>=alias</code> directive is <em>not</em> followed by an
opening bracket, it must be followed by a declarator (such as <code>my</code>,
<code>class</code>, <code>sub</code>, etc.) The declared object then becomes the (read-only)
return value of the alias. For example:
</p><pre><code>    <strong>=alias CLASSNAME</strong>
    class Database::Handle {
        <strong>=alias ATTR</strong>
        has IO $!handle;

        <strong>=alias OPEN</strong>
        my Bool method open ($filename?) {...}

        <strong>=alias DEFNAME</strong>
        constant Str DEFAULT_FILENAME = 'db.log';

        =for para
            Note that the <strong>A&lt;OPEN.name&gt;</strong> method of class <strong>A&lt;CLASSNAME&gt;</strong>
            stores the resulting low-level database handle
            in its private <strong>A&lt;ATTR.name&gt;</strong> attribute. By default,
            handles are opened to the file "<strong>A&lt;DEFNAME&gt;</strong>".

    }
</code></pre><p /><p>This would produce:
</p><blockquote><p>Note that the <code>open</code> method of class <code>Database::Handle</code> stores the
resulting low-level database handle in its private <code>$!handle</code>
attribute. By default, handles are opened to the file "<code>db.log</code>".
</p></blockquote><h1>How Pod is parsed and processed
</h1><p>Pod is just a collection of specialized forms of Perl 6 comment. Every
Perl 6 implementation must provide a special command-line flag that
locates, parses, and processes Pod to produce documentation. That flag
is <kbd>--doc</kbd>.
</p><p>Hence, to read Pod documentation you would type things like:
</p><pre><code>    perl --doc  perlrun
</code></pre><pre><code>    perl --doc  DBI::DBD::Metadata
</code></pre><pre><code>    perl --doc  ./lib/My/Module.pm
</code></pre><p>When the Perl 6 interpreter is run in this mode, it sets the compiler
hint <code>$?DOC</code> to true. If the <kbd>--doc</kbd> flag is given a value, that value
(with a <code>but true</code> added) is placed in <code>$?DOC</code>. This can be used to
specify, for example, the output format desired:
</p><pre><code>    perl --doc=html perldelta  &gt; perldelta.html
</code></pre><p>Under <kbd>--doc</kbd>, the interpreter runs in a special mode, parsing the
source code (including the Pod, as it always does) during compilation
and building the program's syntax tree. However, during parsing and
initialization under <kbd>--doc</kbd>, the interpreter executes any
<code>BEGIN</code>, <code>CHECK</code>, and <code>INIT</code> blocks (and equivalents, such as <code>use</code>
statements and subroutine declarations) that are preceded by the special
prefix: <code>DOC</code>
</p><p>When the <kbd>--doc</kbd> is <em>not</em> specified on the commandline, blocks and
statements that are preceded by the <code>DOC</code> prefix are not executed at all.
</p><p>By default, once the <code>DOC INIT</code> phase is complete, the interpreter then
calls a special default <code>DOC INIT</code> block that walks the AST and
generates the documentation, guided by the content of the <code>$?DOC</code> hint,
the <code>$=POD</code> tree, and any <code>DOC</code> blocks that have loaded Pod-related
handler code.
</p><p>Because the conversion of documentation is just a variation on the
standard Perl 6 compilation process, the processing of any given file of
Pod can be modified from within that file itself by the appropriate
insertion of <code>DOC</code> blocks. For example:
</p><pre><code>    DOC use Pod6::Markovian;
</code></pre><p>or:
</p><pre><code>    DOC BEGIN {
        use Pod6::Literate;
</code></pre><pre><code>        if ($?DOC ~~ /short/) {
            literate_sequence(&lt;
                NAME
                AUTHOR
                SYNOPSIS
                COPYRIGHT
                WARRANTY
                DESCRIPTION
                INTERFACE
                DIAGNOSTICS
            &gt;);
        }
        else {
            literate_sequence(:default);
        }
</code></pre><p>You can even <em>replace</em> the standard Pod processor with your own, so
long as you remember to exit before the default <code>DOC INIT</code> can run:
</p><pre><code>    DOC INIT {
        use My::Pod::To::Text;
</code></pre><pre><code>        pod_to_text( $=POD );
</code></pre><pre><code>        exit(0);
    }
</code></pre><p>The idea is that developers will be able to add their own documentation
mechanisms simply by loading a module (via a <code>DOC use</code>) to augment or
override the default documentation behaviour. Such mechanisms can then
be built using code written in standard Perl 6 that accesses <code>$=POD</code>,
as well as using the <code>.WHY</code> and <code>.WHEREFORE</code> introspection methods of
any constructs that have attached Pod blocks.
</p><p>Note also that this mechanism means that, on many systems, you can
create a self-converting documentation file like so:
</p><pre><code>    #! /usr/bin/perl6 --doc

    =begin pod

    =head1 A document that can write itself

    Executing this document from the commandline will automatically
    convert it to a readable text representation.

    =head2 Et cetera
    ...

    =end pod
